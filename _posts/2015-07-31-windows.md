### Windows install

* 10/06/2016 Due to lack of time I am no longer building a Windows version.
I will leave these instructions here in case anyone wants to try building
so2sdr under Windows.

### Cross-building so2sdr for Windows under Linux

This uses the cross-build tool mxe  [MXE](http://mxe.cc). The default
compiler target for MXE is 32-bit, static linkage. It may be possible
to build shared and 64-bit versions, but I have not tested this.

1. install mxe


        git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git
	
	
2. Install needed packages for mxe. In mxe directory (in my case /usr/local/src/mxe)

        make qt
        make portaudio
        make fftw
        make libltdl
        make nsis

3. Set the path to pick up the MXE tools:


        export PATH=/usr/local/src/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH

4. build hamlib. The hamlib version from sourceforge is old and does not build correctly with mxe. The hamlib git version seemed to work. In the mxe directory:

        git clone https://github.com/N0NB/hamlib.git
        cd hamlib
        sh ./autogen.sh
        ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32.static --enable-static --disable-shared --prefix=/usr/local/src/mxe/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static
        make
        make install

5. some small fixes are needed:
    - in mxe/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/lib

            ln -s libws2_32.a libWs2_32.a
    - qextserialport uses a private Qt header (bad practice!). It is missing
    from the installed MXE Qt files and has to be added.

            cd /usr/local/src/mxe/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/qt/include/QtCore
            mkdir private
            cp /usr/include/qt4/QtCore/private/qwineventnotifier_p.h private/.
    - the current Portaudio does not work correctly with WDMKS when compiled
    with Mingw; when run an error box will pop up. It seems ok to just dismiss
    this box and not use the WDMKS driver. Alternatively, remove 'wdmks' in the
    MXE config script for Portaudio in src/portaudio.mk in the MXE install
    directory.


6. build so2sdr

        git clone https://github.com/n4ogw/so2sdr.git
        cd so2sdr/so2sdr

    Note: there are some separate .ui files for Windows. These make
    the fonts more readable:

        cp so2sdr.ui.win so2sdr.ui
        cp dupesheet.ui.win dupesheet.ui
        i686-w64-mingw32.static-qmake-qt4
        make

    Afterwards so2sdr.exe should be in /release

7. Compress the exe file. With static linkage the exe file is quite large (24 MB). upx can be used to reduce its size to about 30% of original (UPX version 3.91). If this step is skipped, NSIS also applies some compression to the executable.

        upx --best release/so2sdr.exe

8. Make Windows installer package:

        cd ..
        i686-w64-mingw32.static-makensis -X"SetCompressor /FINAL lzma" so2sdr-2.0.0
	
    This is a very basic NSIS installer. To uninstall, run the "uninstall" in the directory so2sdr is installed into. Nothing in the registry is modified. There is also a separate NSIS script for making an install package with just the so2sdr-bandmap program.
