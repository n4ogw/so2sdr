Building the HTML and PDF versions of this manual requires the
asciidoc package which is dependent on docbook and tex packages.
Needless to say, this is a large dependency, and the generation
of the manual is not yet performed through the qmake build system.

To generate the HTML manual:

asciidoc -b html -o so2sdr.html so2sdr.asciidoc

The resulting HTML file is dependent on the images directory for the
screenshots so be certain to copy it along.

To generate the PDF manual:

a2x -f pdf -D . so2sdr.asciidoc

TODO: Integrate the generated manual files into the source and binary
distributions.
