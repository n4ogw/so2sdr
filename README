------------------------


Developer instructions (Linux)
==============================


You will need the following development libraries installed: Qt4, FFTW, Hamlib,
and PortAudio.

Various development packages include g++, Git, and pkg-config. A complete Qt4
development suite (including Qt Creator and Qt 4 Designer) is advised.

1. Clone Tor's repository to your local machine (read only):

    $ git clone git://github.com/n4ogw/so2sdr.git

or, from your account on Git Hub create your own fork of Tor's repository and
clone a read/write repository to your local machine.

2. By default, so2sdr will be installed in /usr/local/bin, and associated
data files will be placed in /usr/local/share/so2sdr. If you want to
change the location of the program, edit SO2SDR_INSTALL_DIR in common.pri

3. qmake

4. make

N.B. Subdirectory Makefiles will be created from the top level Makefile.

5. (as superuser) make install

6. Test and contribute!


-----------------------


Building under Windows/Visual Studio
====================================


You will need Qt4, FFTW, Hamlib, and PortAudio libraries

1. Clone the Git repository as above

2. edit so2sdr/so2sdr.pro, select "vcapp" rather than "app" for TEMPLATE

3. you may also want to adjust the directory for portaudio in the .pro file
    TODO: Integrate Package Config

4. open Qt command window. In top-level directory for so2sdr do

qmake -tp vc -r

4. now there should be .sln solution file for Windows
